# Ruby is sometimes a bit tricky to install with mise
# One issue I had was:
# following extensions are not compiled: psych: Could not be configured. It will not be installed.
# Solved with the following:
# brew reinstall libyaml
# gem install psych -- --with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# sudo gem install psych -- --with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# and then running mise install again installed latest ruby without issues
