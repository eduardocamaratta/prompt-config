# Ruby is sometimes a bit tricky to install with mise

# The issue I had on macOS:
# * following extensions are not compiled: psych: Could not be configured. It will not be installed.
# Solved with the following:
# > brew reinstall libyaml
# > gem install psych -- --with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# > sudo gem install psych -- --with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# > export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS=--with-libyaml-dir=$(brew --prefix libyaml)
# and then running mise install again installed latest ruby without issues

# The issues I had on WSL and Mint (only difference is Linux already had gcc installed):
# * gcc wasn't installed
# > sudo apt update
# > sudo apt upgrade -y
# > sudo apt install build-essential -y
# * ruby compilation failed with: fatal error: zlib.h: No such file or directory
# > sudo apt install zlib1g-dev
# * ruby installation failed with: can't install following extensions are not compiled fiddle psych
# > sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev libffi-dev
